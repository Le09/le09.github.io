<!-- TODO?
  The first time I heard about MyFamicase was just before the deadline, and so I pulled an all-nighter to get my illustration done within the time limit. I managed to get something fairly close to what I was going for, but not cute enough, nor polished enough.
I had ideas for the next two years, to make one for Cosmoose and one for Leonine (my own little universe).

However, I absolutely forgot about it and ended up pulling an all nighter for the second one too.
The result was absolutely nothing like my initial idea, even though I'm not unhappy with the result.
A bit too messy probably, I could have simplified things for a better effect.
Dissatisfied with myself, I started work on the third illustration the next day... knowing full well that I'd have to wait one year before being allowed to show it (the rule is that the illustrations should stay secret until the exposition).
I made different drafts with different perspectives, trying to get a good composition... and never got back to it.

I only remembered 11 months later, so I had to do it in one night, once again. And I was too tired to stay awake too late so the night was reduced to one evening. I found one draft satisfying and started to complete it... and then realized there was no way to put the elements I had planned without destroying the composition. The time limit committed me fully to it, and the illustration's mood shifted to comfy instead. This year, I'll start early so that I can achieve that missed idea...
